Whats does the fox say?
Nothing is true everything is permitted
Break a leg
All roads lead to Rome
Shoot someone's fox
Procrastination is the thief of time
Rules were made to be broken
The work praises the man
False friends are worse than open enemies
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
