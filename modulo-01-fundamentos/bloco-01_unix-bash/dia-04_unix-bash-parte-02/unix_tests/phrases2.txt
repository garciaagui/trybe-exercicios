People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones
Necessity is the mother of invention
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Cheese, wine, and friends must be old to be good
Doubt is the beginning, not the end, of wisdom
Good talk saves the food
Learn a language, and you will avoid a war
One kind word can warm three winter months
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
